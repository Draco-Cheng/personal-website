# AI_README: Project Index & Conventions

This file is intended as a machine-readable and human-friendly index for AI assistants (such as GPT) and future contributors.  
It describes the overall architecture, conventions, and best practices for this monorepo.

---

## Monorepo Overview

- **Monorepo manager:** Nx
- **Languages:** TypeScript (frontend), Python (backend)
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15+ (App Router, Atomic Design, CSS Modules)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.10+)
- **Component Architecture:** Atomic Design (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
- **API Convention:** All backend endpoints are prefixed with `/api`
- **Scripts:** Cross-language scripts in `/scripts`
- **Nx targets:** All build/serve/test tasks are managed via Nx and/or scripts

## General Conventions

- **Naming:** Use lowerCamelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/classes, kebab-case for folders/files.
- **Atomic Design:** All UI components are organized by atomic level under `src/components/`.
- **Application-level logic:** Place in `templates/`, `pages/`, or directly in `app/` (Next.js).
- **Config:** Use language-native config files, but keep API prefixes and shared constants in a single place per language.
- **TypeScript:** Use strict typing, prefer interfaces for props and API responses.
- **Python:** Use type hints, keep config in `config.py` or `pyproject.toml`.
- **Release is TAG-ONLY:** CD (`deploy.yml`) never bumps `package.json`/`pyproject.toml` or commits back to `main`. Version lives in the git tag; `nx release version --dry-run` computes it, then `git tag` pushes it directly. All manifest `version` fields are decorative (`0.0.0`).
- `manual-deploy.yml`'s `clean_namespace` input deletes the live K8s namespace — gated behind `confirm_namespace` (must exactly match `K8S_NAMESPACE`, checked in the "Clean namespace" step) so a stray checkbox click can't wipe production.
- `nx:run-commands` targets are UNCACHED unless `cache: true` in `nx.json` targetDefaults — persisting `.nx/cache` alone does nothing.
- A workflow running cacheable targets MUST be listed in `namedInputs.sharedGlobals`, else editing it invalidates nothing (ci.yml, deploy.yml, e2e.yml all are). manual-deploy.yml runs ONLY `deploy` (uncacheable by design, it mutates the cluster), so it needs neither cache step nor the sharedGlobals entry.
- `helm/` + `.github/scripts/` are OUTSIDE the nx graph — `nx affected` returns empty for infra-only commits, so `deploy.yml`'s `check` job also greps `git diff` for those paths. Without that, an infra-only change merges green and the deploy job never runs.
- `astral-sh/setup-uv` needs `prune-cache: false` — the post-job prune hangs, is killed at exactly 5m00s, and logs a red "exit code 2" that does NOT fail the build. Pruning only shrinks the upload; the cache itself stays correct without it.

## AI Usage

- When using GPT or other AI tools, reference this file and the per-app AI_README files for context.
- Always follow the conventions and structure described here unless there is a strong reason to deviate.
